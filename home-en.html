			<h1>THE BIRDCODE PROJECT</h1>
			

			<p>The BirdCode Project is a research initiative focused on the design, structuring, development and presentation of a set of conceptual and methodological strategies, according to the guidelines of the <strong>STEM Methodology</strong>, in order to offer the educational community of Colombia and the world a model of workflows and activities for the construction of academic and work skills in technologies, software development and construction of spatial databases by teachers and students of secondary and middle school. The use of open data and the construction of databases constitute the main strategy on which the entire Project is developed. The datasets freely available on the internet that are proposed to be integrated within the BirdCode Project correspond to thematic information on flora and fauna species records in the territories and around the globe; This approach to work on biodiversity data takes into account the strategic importance of the conservation and use of these resources for economic growth, the generation of employment opportunities, the production of goods, services and information, and the promotion of productive activities in the communities that contribute to the construction of collective knowledge on biodiversity that will train new generations, individually and collectively, both in the conservation of this wealth and in the exploration of entrepreneurial options that combine topics such as technology, the economic value of biodiversity, nature tourism services, the use of flora and fauna resources for agriculture and industry, and bilingualism.</p>

			<p>This educational approach, which corresponds to <mark>Science, Technology, Engineer and Mathematics</mark>, contributes to overcome the curricular fragmentation between the already named areas of technology, science, engineering and mathematics, together with the other areas and from the instrumental conditions that allow children and young people such as STEM+H from human rights. Based on interactive learning approach promotes interdisciplinary construction in real contexts, through the realization of projects and problem solving, through the realization of the following steps (Santillán, 2019): 1. Diagnosis and recognition of the initial situation or problem, 2. Identification of goals, 3.Planning of actions to achieve the goals, 4. Interdisciplinary implementation to improve the diagnosed situation and 5. Evaluation of the level of achievement reached in the Project.</p>

				<h2>ECONOMIC VALUE OF BIODIVERSITY</h2>
			</header>

			<p>Biota and ecosystems represent a form of wealth, biological wealth. Thus, the variety of genes, species, communities, ecosystems and landscapes make up the biodiversity of the earth, which sustains human life and economic activities. For several decades, economic development has been one of the causes of the deterioration of the planet, with the consequent loss of biological diversity. The resources obtained from the exploitation of forests, seas, cultivated lands, wildlife and the extraction of active ingredients in medicines, among others, have been fundamental in the construction of today's world. It is only very recently that awareness has been raised about the importance of the services provided by biodiversity in relation to the regulation of climate, water, soils, nutrients, the course of biogeochemical cycles, pest control, pollination processes, etc. . Hence, the problem has had to be analyzed and proposals made on the economic value of biodiversity, which will undoubtedly be fundamental inputs in decision-making in the international market and nature conservation. Currently, biodiversity has been given an economic value from various perspectives (Cox, 2000; Primack et al., 2001; Groom et al., 2006); In principle, this value was divided into two large groups, the intrinsic or inherent and the instrumental or utilitarian. Utilitarian value can be attributed to the provision of goods, services, information and psycho-spiritual benefits. Read more <a href="Biodiversidad.html" target="_blank">Here</a></p>

				<h2>Programming as a strategy for the development of computational thinking</h2>
			</header>

			<p>Programming is a form of expression and a strategy that allows shaping ideas (Sanchez Vera & Gonzales - Martinez, 2019), which pedagogically coincides with the constructivist theory that holds that the student constructs his own knowledge actively to promote meaningful learning (Tigse Parreño, 2019). See, for example, the pedagogical uses of Scratch and Code.org. In this sense, the Ministerio de Educación Nacional de Colombia proposes programming as a didactic strategy in that it contributes to closing the digital divide, improving fluency in the creation and use of technology, strengthening the capacity for calculation and logic, computational and logical-mathematical thinking (Martinez & Gómez, 2018), necessary for the solution of computer-related problems, in particular and technological problems, in general.</p>

				<h2>Networks and virtual communities</h2>
			</header>

			<p>Based on the implementation of collaborative and connectionist technologies in line with connectivist pedagogical models, focused on online learning. <strong>The pedagogical implementation of social networks, virtual learning networks and communities of practice seek to generate the active participation of children and adolescents to share experience, develop collaborative work, learn together and solve common problems.</strong></p>

			<p>Social networks seek to develop interactive communication skills, starting from the formation of groups to share content, experiences, carry out discussions and joint conceptual constructions or plan and develop joint activities or products. The members of these social groups assume roles such as, for example: leader in charge of general production, integrator in charge of monitoring tasks, documentary filmmaker in charge of keeping records of joint productions, and multimedia specialist in charge of media and production management, the curator or content creator. It allows various forms of collaborative work.</p>

			<p>Virtual learning networks are based on the joint production of collaborative knowledge in formal training situations, through the determination of the students' previous knowledge, the setting of an initial challenge and guiding questions to relate previous knowledge with the knowledge to be built, the exploration of contents, resources and support information, and the development of learning activities based on the negotiation of knowledge.</p>
			
			<p>The communities of practice seek to solve problems that arise from common interests, generating commitment from all members of the community in the process, building joint goals and sharing languages and ways of doing things that are specific to the community. This is achieved through the development of phases of creation of the communities, their cohesion, maturation and management of activities and transformation of knowledge.</p>

				<h2>Proposed technologies: Python, PostgreSQL, QGIS 3 and Git.</h2>
			</header>

			<p>This proposal for the training of teachers and students of middle and high school in software programming, spatial databases and geographic information systems presents the educational community of Colombia and Latin America with the programmatic use of the following technologies for the development of content that will allow them to carry out research projects in the classroom:</p>

			<h3>Python</h3>

			<p>Python is a programming language widely used in web applications, software development, data science and machine learning (ML). Developers use Python because it is efficient and easy to learn, plus it can run on many different platforms. Python software is free to download, integrates well with all types of systems and increases the speed of development.</p>

			<h3>Python for teachers</h3>

			<p>Python is one of the most powerful programming languages used in mathematics, natural sciences and engineering. In general, Python permeates web development environments, data science, artificial intelligence, scientific computing and numerical analysis. These reasons make learning Python a competitive advantage in the world of work and academia.</p>

			<p>The BirdCode Project seeks to bring teachers and students of mathematics, natural sciences and bilingualism closer to the Python programming language from three points of view. The first is to generate solid foundations of the language itself, the second is to build in classroom research spaces numerical applications and serious games supported by spatial databases to learn natural sciences, biodiversity issues in ecosystems, mathematics and bilingualism using the language, and the third is to build collaborative learning networks with groups of students interested in the topics of technology and natural sciences whose results are hosted in the cloud through remote repositories of Python code development, which promote collaborative work and the formation of skills that contribute to classroom research on interdisciplinary topics. In this way, students can assume an active and participatory role that contributes to the construction of knowledge about biodiversity present in the territories in which they live and that exemplifies the theory of Python code development as seen through the BirdCode Program. You can read more about the Python training proposal <a href="Python.html" target="_blank">Here</a></p>


			<h3>PostgreSQL</h3>

			<p>PostgreSQL, commonly pronounced "Post - GRES", is an open source database that has a solid reputation for reliability, flexibility and support for open technical standards. Unlike other RDMBS (relational database management systems), PostgreSQL supports both relational and non-relational data types. This makes it one of the most compatible, stable and mature relational databases available today.</p>

			<h3>Why use PostgreSQL?</h3>

			<p>Maintaining dynamic database systems is critical in today's digital landscape, especially considering the speed at which new technologies are emerging. PostgreSQL is expandable and versatile, so it can support a wide variety of specialized use cases with a powerful extension ecosystem, ranging from time series data types to geospatial analysis. Its versatile and accessible design makes PostgreSQL a "one-size-fits-all" solution for many companies looking for cost-effective and efficient ways to enhance their database management systems.</p>


			<h3>QGIS 3</h3>

			<h3>Diva GIS</h3>

			<h3>Git y Github</h3>


			<h3>GBIF API</h3>
